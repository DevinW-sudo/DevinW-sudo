### Hi there 👋

<!--
**DevinW-sudo/DevinW-sudo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

- 💡 I'm a Joint Ph.D. student and Associate Instructor at Indiana University. I previously worked as an Adjunct Faculty Instructor at Utah Valley University where I taught undergraduate computer science courses in their CS Department. I've also previously worked AI/ML/NLP related internships with NASA and conducted/published research with the UVU Source Code Lab.

- 🎓 Education: 
  - Joint Ph.D. (student) Informatics & Cognitive Science - Indiana University
  - B.S. Computer Science - Utah Valley University

- 🧑‍🔬 Research Labs:
  - [CNetS](https://cnets.indiana.edu/)
    - [YY Group](https://yongyeol.com/group/)
  - [Experimental Humanities Lab](https://www.experimentalhumanities.com/people)

- 🔭 I'm currently conducting research on:
  - Check my research page! [Research](https://devwright.com/2.%20Research/)
  - Or my Publications page! [Publications](https://devwright.com/1.%20Publications/)
- 👨‍🏫 I'm currently an Associate Instructor for:
    - INFO-I590 Data Visualization (Python, Jupyter)
    - INFO-I422 Data Visualization (Python, Jupyter)
    - INFO-I123 Data Fluency
- 👨‍🏫 I previously taught the folowing Computer Science courses (Instructor of Record):
    - CS2420 Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (Python, Julia)
    - CS2810 Computer Organization and Architecture (LC-3, Assembly, Machine Language)
    - CS2370 C++ Programming (C++, of course)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: embedding methods, information theory, LLMs, transformer architecture, etc.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Research broadly within the cultural evolution, computational social science, and the cognitive science of religion. I use methods from data science, NLP/NLU/Corpus Linguistics, complex networks and systems science, and a little computational modeling. 
    - Bonus points for cultural evolution or cognitive science of religion.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: TBA
- 💬 Ask me about: digital humanities (I'm new, but possibly helpful!)
